# This configuration file binds many vi- and vim-like bindings to the
# appropriate tmux key bindings.  Note that for many key bindings there is no
# tmux analogue.  This is intended for tmux 1.3, which handles pane selection
# differently from the previous versions

# split windows like vim
# vim's definition of a horizontal/vertical split is reversed from tmux's
bind t split-window -v
bind | split-window -h

# move around panes with hjkl, as one would in vim after pressing ctrl-w
bind h select-pane -L
bind j select-pane -D
bind k select-pane -U
bind l select-pane -R

# resize panes like vim
# feel free to change the "1" to however many lines you want to resize by, only
# one at a time can be slow
bind < resize-pane -L 1
bind > resize-pane -R 42
bind - resize-pane -D 1
bind + resize-pane -U 1

# bind : to command-prompt like vim
# this is the default in tmux already
bind : command-prompt

# vi-style controls for copy mode
setw -g mode-keys vi

# setting default terminal
set -g default-terminal "screen-256color"

# set Zsh as your default Tmux shell
set-option -g default-shell /bin/zsh

# UTF is great, let us use that
set -g utf8
set-window-option -g utf8 on

# Tmux uses a 'control key', let's set it to 'Ctrl-a'
# Reason: 'Ctrl-a' is easier to reach than 'Ctrl-b'
set -g prefix C-a
unbind C-b

# Set the numbering of windows to go from 1 instead
# of 0 - silly programmers :|
set-option -g base-index 1
setw -g pane-base-index 1

# Allow us to reload our Tmux configuration while
# using Tmux
bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf \; display "Reloaded!"
